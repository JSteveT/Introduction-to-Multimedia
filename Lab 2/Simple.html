            To be, or not to be, that is the question:
            Whether 'tis Nobler in the mind to suffer
            The Slings and Arrows of outrageous Fortune,
            Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles,
            And by opposing end them: to die, to sleep
            No more; and by a sleep, to say we end
            The Heart-ache, and the thousand Natural shocks
            That Flesh is heir to? 'Tis a consummation
            Devoutly to be wished. To die to sleep,
            To sleep, perchance to Dream; Aye, there's the rub,
            For in that sleep of death, what dreams may come,
            When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
            Must give us pause.
